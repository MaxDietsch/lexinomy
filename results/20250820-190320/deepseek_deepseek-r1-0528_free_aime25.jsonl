The number \\(17_b\\) equals \\(1 \\cdot b + 7 = b + 7\\). The number \\(97_b\\) equals \\(9 \\cdot b + 7 = 9b + 7\\).\n\nThe condition that \\(17_b\\) divides \\(97_b\\) means that \\(\\frac{9b + 7}{b + 7}\\) is an integer. This fraction simplifies as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9b + 7}{b + 7} = \\frac{9(b + 7) - 56}{b + 7} = 9 - \\frac{56}{b + 7}.\n\\]\n\nFor this expression to be an integer, \\(\\frac{56}{b + 7}\\) must be an integer. Thus, \\(b + 7\\) must be a divisor of 56.\n\nThe positive divisors of 56 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, and 56. Since \\(b > 9\\), it follows that \\(b + 7 > 16\\). The divisors greater than 16 are 28 and 56.\n\n- If \\(b + 7 = 28\\), then \\(b = 21\\).\n- If \\(b + 7 = 56\\), then \\(b = 49\\).\n\nBoth bases satisfy the digit condition: for \\(b = 21 > 9\\), digits 9 and 7 are both less than 21; for \\(b = 49 > 9\\), digits 9 and 7 are both less than 49.\n\nVerification:\n- For \\(b = 21\\): \\(17_{21} = 1 \\cdot 21 + 7 = 28\\), \\(97_{21} = 9 \\cdot 21 + 7 = 196\\), and \\(\\frac{196}{28} = 7\\), an integer.\n- For \\(b = 49\\): \\(17_{49} = 1 \\cdot 49 + 7 = 56\\), \\(97_{49} = 9 \\cdot 49 + 7 = 448\\), and \\(\\frac{448}{56} = 8\\), an integer.\n\nNo other divisors of 56 are greater than 16, and negative divisors are not considered because \\(b + 7 > 16 > 0\\).\n\nThe bases are 21 and 49. Their sum is \\(21 + 49 = 70\\).\n\nThus, the sum of all such bases is 70.\n\nThe final answer is 70.\n\n\\boxed{70}", "extracted_final_answer": 70, "is_correct": true, "tokens": {"prompt_tokens": 72, "completion_tokens": 5240, "total_tokens": 5312}}
