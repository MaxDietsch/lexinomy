The subscript $b$ indicates that these numbers are in base $b$. To work with them, it's often helpful to convert them to base 10.\n\nConverting $17_b$ to base 10:\n- $17_b = 1 \\times b^1 + 7 \\times b^0 = b + 7$\n\nConverting $97_b$ to base 10:\n- $97_b = 9 \\times b^1 + 7 \\times b^0 = 9b + 7$\n\n### The Condition Given\n\nThe problem states that $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$ in base $b$. In base 10 terms, this means:\n\\[ b + 7 \\text{ divides } 9b + 7 \\]\n\nMathematically, this can be written as:\n\\[ 9b + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{b + 7} \\]\n\n### Solving the Divisibility Condition\n\nTo find when $b + 7$ divides $9b + 7$, we can perform polynomial division or use the property that if $d$ divides $n$, then $d$ divides any linear combination of $n$ and $d$. Here, let's find an expression where the variable $b$ is eliminated.\n\nNotice that:\n\\[ 9b + 7 = 9(b + 7) - 56 \\]\nSo:\n\\[ 9b + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{b + 7} \\implies 9(b + 7) - 56 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{b + 7} \\]\nSince $9(b + 7)$ is always divisible by $b + 7$, we have:\n\\[ -56 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{b + 7} \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ b + 7 \\text{ divides } 56 \\]\n\n### Finding Divisors of 56\n\nThe positive divisors of 56 are:\n\\[ 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56 \\]\n\nSince $b > 9$, we have $b + 7 > 16$. So we look for divisors greater than 16:\n\\[ 28, 56 \\]\n\nThus:\n\\[ b + 7 = 28 \\implies b = 21 \\]\n\\[ b + 7 = 56 \\implies b = 49 \\]\n\nBut wait, $b + 7 > 16$ implies $b > 9$. Both 21 and 49 are greater than 9, so these are valid.\n\nHowever, we must also ensure that the digits in $17_b$ and $97_b$ are valid in base $b$. \n\n- For $17_b$: digits are 1 and 7. Since 7 < b, this is valid as long as b > 7.\n- For $97_b$: digits are 9 and 7. Since both 9 and 7 must be less than b, we need b > 9.\n\nGiven that $b > 9$ already satisfies $b > 7$, both bases are valid.\n\n### Verifying the Solutions\n\nLet's verify both potential bases.\n\n1. **Case b = 21:**\n   - $17_{21} = 1 \\times 21 + 7 = 28$\n   - $97_{21} = 9 \\times 21 + 7 = 196$\n   - Check if 196 is divisible by 28: $196 / 28 = 7$, which is an integer. ✅\n\n2. **Case b = 49:**\n   - $17_{49} = 1 \\times 49 + 7 = 56$\n   - $97_{49} = 9 \\times 49 + 7 = 448$\n   - Check if 448 is divisible by 56: $448 / 56 = 8$, which is an integer. ✅\n\nBoth bases satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Checking for Other Possible Bases\n\nInitially, we considered only positive divisors of 56 greater than 16. However, negative divisors could also satisfy $b + 7$ divides 56, but since bases $b > 9$, we have $b + 7 > 16$, so negative divisors are irrelevant here (they would imply $b < -7$, which contradicts $b > 9$).\n\nAlso, smaller divisors give $b \\leq 16$:\n- $b + 7 = 1 \\implies b = -6$ (invalid, b > 9)\n- $b + 7 = 2 \\implies b = -5$\n- ...\n- $b + 7 = 14 \\implies b = 7$ (invalid, b > 9 required and digits in $97_b$ require $b > 9$)\n\nThus, no other bases satisfy $b > 9$ and the digit constraints.\n\n### Summing the Valid Bases\n\nThe valid bases are $b = 21$ and $b = 49$. Their sum is:\n\\[ 21 + 49 = 70 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the problem, the sum of all integer bases $b > 9$ satisfying the given condition is:\n\nThe final answer is 70", "extracted_final_answer": 70, "is_correct": true, "tokens": {"prompt_tokens": 78, "completion_tokens": 1127, "total_tokens": 1205}}
