I need to find the sum of all integer bases b > 9 where 17_b divides 97_b. Hmm, first, I should understand what 17_b and 97_b mean in base b.\n\nSo, in base b, the number 17_b would be 1 * b + 7 * 1, right? So that's b + 7. Similarly, 97_b would be 9 * b + 7 * 1, which is 9b + 7.\n\nThe problem says that 17_b must divide 97_b, which means (9b + 7) divided by (b + 7) should be an integer. So, I can write this as (9b + 7)/(b + 7) = some integer k.\n\nI need to find all bases b > 9 where this fraction is an integer. Let me try to simplify this expression. Maybe I can perform polynomial division or manipulate it algebraically.\n\nLet me write 9b + 7 as 9(b + 7) - 56. Because 9(b + 7) would be 9b + 63, and 9b + 7 is 9b + 63 - 56. So:\n\n(9b + 7)/(b + 7) = [9(b + 7) - 56]/(b + 7) = 9 - 56/(b + 7)\n\nSo for this to be an integer, 56/(b + 7) must also be an integer. That means (b + 7) must be a divisor of 56.\n\nNow, b > 9, so b + 7 > 16. I need to find all divisors of 56 that are greater than 16 because b + 7 > 16.\n\nFirst, let's list all the positive divisors of 56. The prime factorization of 56 is 2^3 * 7^1. So the divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\n\nNow, from these, the ones greater than 16 are 28 and 56. So b + 7 can be 28 or 56.\n\nTherefore, if b + 7 = 28, then b = 21. If b + 7 = 56, then b = 49.\n\nAre there any other divisors of 56? Negative divisors? Well, since the base b must be greater than 9, and b is positive, we don't need to consider negative divisors.\n\nSo the valid bases are b = 21 and b = 49.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum of all such bases. So 21 + 49 = 70.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor b = 21:\n17_21 = 1*21 + 7 = 28\n97_21 = 9*21 + 7 = 189 + 7 = 196\n196 divided by 28 is 7, which is an integer. So that works.\n\nFor b = 49:\n17_49 = 1*49 + 7 = 56\n97_49 = 9*49 + 7 = 441 + 7 = 448\n448 divided by 56 is 8, which is an integer. That also works.\n\nAre there any other b's? Since the only divisors of 56 greater than 16 are 28 and 56, and that gives b = 21 and 49, which are both greater than 9, I think that's it.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 21 + 49 = 70.\nAnswer: 70", "extracted_final_answer": 70, "is_correct": true, "tokens": {"prompt_tokens": 66, "completion_tokens": 789, "total_tokens": 855}}
