Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \\( 17_b \\) and \\( 97_b \\) represent in base \\( b \\). In base \\( b \\), a number like \\( 17_b \\) means \\( 1 \\times b + 7 \\times 1 \\), right? So, \\( 17_b = b + 7 \\). Similarly, \\( 97_b = 9 \\times b + 7 \\times 1 = 9b + 7 \\).\n\nSo, the problem is asking for all bases \\( b > 9 \\) where \\( b + 7 \\) divides \\( 9b + 7 \\). In other words, \\( \\frac{9b + 7}{b + 7} \\) should be an integer.\n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9b + 7}{b + 7} = k\\quad \\text{where}\\quad k \\text{ is an integer}\n\\]\n\nNow, I can simplify this fraction. Let's perform polynomial long division or manipulate the numerator to make the denominator a factor:\n\n\\[\n9b + 7 = 9(b + 7) - 56\n\\]\n\nWait, how did I get that? Let me check:\n\n\\( 9(b + 7) = 9b + 63 \\), so if I subtract 56, I get \\( 9b + 7 \\). Yes, that's correct. So,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9b + 7}{b + 7} = \\frac{9(b + 7) - 56}{b + 7} = 9 - \\frac{56}{b + 7}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, for the entire expression to be an integer, \\( \\frac{56}{b + 7} \\) must also be an integer. That means \\( b + 7 \\) must be a divisor of 56.\n\nNow, I need to find all integer divisors of 56 and then determine the corresponding \\( b \\) values that are greater than 9.\n\nFirst, let's list all divisors of 56. The positive divisors are:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\n\nAnd the negative divisors are:\n\n-1, -2, -4, -7, -8, -14, -28, -56.\n\nBut since the base \\( b \\) must be greater than 9, and \\( b + 7 \\) must be a divisor of 56, we can consider both positive and negative divisors.\n\nBut wait, bases are positive integers greater than the largest digit in the number. The digits in \\( 17_b \\) and \\( 97_b \\) are 9 and 7, so the base \\( b \\) must be at least \\( 9 + 1 = 10 \\). So negative divisors won't make sense here because \\( b + 7 \\) would be negative or less than 9 + 7 = 16 if we take positive divisors less than 16. Wait, let me think again.\n\nGiven \\( b > 9 \\), \\( b + 7 > 16 \\). So, only divisors of 56 greater than 16. Looking at the positive divisors:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\n\nThe ones greater than 16 are 28 and 56.\n\nBut the negative divisors would give \\( b + 7 \\) negative, so \\( b \\) would be less than -7, but \\( b \\) must be > 9, so negative divisors won't work.\n\nTherefore, only \\( b + 7 = 28 \\) or \\( b + 7 = 56 \\).\n\nLet's solve for \\( b \\):\n\n1. \\( b + 7 = 28 \\) ⇒ \\( b = 21 \\)\n2. \\( b + 7 = 56 \\) ⇒ \\( b = 49 \\)\n\nSo, the bases are 21 and 49. Wait, is that all? Are there any other divisors of 56 that could be greater than 16 when considering their absolute values for negative divisors? Well, negative divisors would lead to negative bases, which are invalid in this context, so only positive divisors.\n\nTherefore, the bases are 21 and 49. The sum is \\( 21 + 49 = 70 \\).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If \\( b = 21 \\), then \\( 17_{21} = 1 \\times 21 + 7 = 28 \\), and \\( 97_{21} = 9 \\times 21 + 7 = 196 \\). Now, \\( 196 ÷ 28 = 7 \\), which is an integer. So it works.\n\nFor \\( b = 49 \\), \\( 17_{49} = 1 \\times 49 + 7 = 56 \\), and \\( 97_{49} = 9 \\times 49 + 7 = 448 \\). \\( 448 ÷ 56 = 8 \\), which is also an integer. So this works too.\n\nAre there any other divisors? Well, if we consider \\( b + 7 = 14 \\), then \\( b = 7 \\), but \\( b > 9 \\), so no. Similarly, \\( b + 7 = 8 \\) gives \\( b = 1 \\), which is too small.\n\nWhat about \\( b + 7 = 7 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), invalid. So indeed, only 28 and 56 work.\n\nThus, the sum is 21 + 49 = 70.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is \\boxed{70}.\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all integer bases \\( b > 9 \\) for which \\( 17_b \\) is a divisor of \\( 97_b \\). \n\nFirst, we convert the numbers from base \\( b \\) to base 10:\n- \\( 17_b = 1 \\times b + 7 = b + 7 \\)\n- \\( 97_b = 9 \\times b + 7 = 9b + 7 \\)\n\nWe need \\( b + 7 \\) to divide \\( 9b + 7 \\). This can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\frac{9b + 7}{b + 7} = k \\quad \\text{where} \\quad k \\text{ is an integer}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{9b + 7}{b + 7} = 9 - \\frac{56}{b + 7}\n\\]\n\nFor the entire expression to be an integer, \\( \\frac{56}{b + 7} \\) must also be an integer. Therefore, \\( b + 7 \\) must be a divisor of 56. The positive divisors of 56 are:\n\\[\n1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56\n\\]\n\nSince \\( b > 9 \\), we have \\( b + 7 > 16 \\). The divisors of 56 greater than 16 are 28 and 56. Solving for \\( b \\):\n1. \\( b + 7 = 28 \\) gives \\( b = 21 \\)\n2. \\( b + 7 = 56 \\) gives \\( b = 49 \\)\n\nWe verify:\n- For \\( b = 21 \\), \\( 17_{21} = 28 \\) and \\( 97_{21} = 196 \\). \\( 196 \\div 28 = 7 \\), which is an integer.\n- For \\( b = 49 \\), \\( 17_{49} = 56 \\) and \\( 97_{49} = 448 \\). \\( 448 \\div 56 = 8 \\), which is an integer.\n\nThus, the valid bases are 21 and 49. The sum of these bases is:\n\\[\n21 + 49 = 70\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{70}.", "extracted_final_answer": null, "is_correct": false, "tokens": {"prompt_tokens": 71, "completion_tokens": 1720, "total_tokens": 1791}}
