The subscript \\( b \\) means that these numbers are written in base \\( b \\). \n\n### Understanding the Numbers in Base \\( b \\)\n\n1. **Convert \\( 17_b \\) to base 10:**\n   The number \\( 17_b \\) means:\n   \\[ 1 \\times b^1 + 7 \\times b^0 = b + 7 \\]\n\n2. **Convert \\( 97_b \\) to base 10:**\n   Similarly, \\( 97_b \\) is:\n   \\[ 9 \\times b^1 + 7 \\times b^0 = 9b + 7 \\]\n\n### Problem Restatement in Base 10\nThe problem is asking for all integer bases \\( b > 9 \\) such that \\( b + 7 \\) divides \\( 9b + 7 \\). \n\n### Solving the Divisibility Condition\nI need to find all \\( b > 9 \\) such that \\( (b + 7) \\) divides \\( (9b + 7) \\).\n\nThis is a divisibility condition. Let me recall that if \\( b + 7 \\) divides \\( 9b + 7 \\), then there exists some integer \\( k \\) such that:\n\\[ 9b + 7 = k \\times (b + 7) \\]\n\nBut I'm not sure how to find \\( k \\) directly. Maybe I can perform polynomial division or rewrite the condition.\n\n### Using Polynomial Division Approach\nLet's consider \\( 9b + 7 \\) divided by \\( b + 7 \\).\n\nI recall that for any polynomial \\( P(b) \\), \\( P(-7) \\) gives the remainder when \\( P(b) \\) is divided by \\( b + 7 \\).\n\nBut \\( P(b) = 9b + 7 \\), so:\n\\[ P(-7) = 9 \\times (-7) + 7 = -63 + 7 = -56 \\]\n\nBut \\( P(-7) \\) is the remainder, and for \\( b + 7 \\) to divide \\( P(b) \\), the remainder must be zero. \n\n**But the remainder is -56, not zero!**\n\nHmm, this suggests that \\( b + 7 \\) never divides \\( 9b + 7 \\) exactly. But the problem says there are such \\( b > 9 \\).\n\n### Re-evaluating the Approach\nMaybe I made a mistake. The division approach gives a remainder, but perhaps \\( b + 7 \\) must divide the remainder.\n\nFrom the division algorithm, we can express \\( 9b + 7 \\) as:\n\\[ 9b + 7 = 9 \\times (b + 7) - 56 \\]\n\nThis is because:\n\\[ 9 \\times (b + 7) = 9b + 63 \\]\n\\[ (9b + 7) = (9b + 63) - 56 \\]\n\nThus:\n\\[ 9b + 7 = 9(b + 7) - 56 \\]\n\nFor \\( b + 7 \\) to divide \\( 9b + 7 \\), it must also divide the remainder \\( -56 \\) (or equivalently, \\( 56 \\), since divisibility is concerned with the absolute value).\n\n### Solving \\( b + 7 \\) divides 56\nThe condition \\( b + 7 \\) divides \\( 56 \\) can be written as:\n\\[ b + 7 \\) is a divisor of \\( 56 \\).\n\nFirst, list all positive divisors of \\( 56 \\):\n\\[ 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56 \\]\n\nSince \\( b > 9 \\), we need to find \\( b \\) such that \\( b + 7 \\) is one of these divisors and \\( b > 9 \\).\n\nLet's solve \\( b + 7 = d \\), where \\( d \\) is a divisor of \\( 56 \\), and \\( b = d - 7 > 9 \\).\n\nLet's check each divisor:\n\n1. **\\( d = 1 \\)**\n   \\[ b = 1 - 7 = -6 \\]\n   But \\( b > 9 \\) is not satisfied.\n\n2. **\\( d = 2 \\)**\n   \\[ b = 2 - 7 = -5 \\]\n   Not valid.\n\n3. **\\( d = 4 \\)**\n   \\[ b = 4 - 7 = -3 \\]\n   Not valid.\n\n4. **\\( d = 7 \\)**\n   \\[ b = 7 - 7 = 0 \\]\n   Not valid.\n\n5. **\\( d = 8 \\)**\n   \\[ b = 8 - 7 = 1 \\]\n   Not valid since \\( b > 9 \\).\n\n6. **\\( d = 14 \\)**\n   \\[ b = 14 - 7 = 7 \\]\n   Not valid since \\( b > 9 \\).\n\n7. **\\( d = 28 \\)**\n   \\[ b = 28 - 7 = 21 \\]\n   Valid, because \\( b = 21 > 9 \\).\n\n8. **\\( d = 56 \\)**\n   \\[ b = 56 - 7 = 49 \\]\n   Valid, because \\( b = 49 > 9 \\).\n\n### Verification of the Bases\nNow, I need to ensure that in base \\( b \\), the digits are valid. Specifically, the number \\( 17_b \\) has digits \\( 1 \\) and \\( 7 \\), which must be less than \\( b \\). Since \\( b \\) is 21 and 49 in the valid cases:\n\n1. For \\( b = 21 \\):\n   - Digits \\( 1 \\) and \\( 7 \\) are both less than \\( 21 \\). Valid.\n\n2. For \\( b = 49 \\):\n   - Digits \\( 1 \\) and \\( 7 \\) are both less than \\( 49 \\). Valid.\n\n### Conclusion\nOnly \\( b = 21 \\) and \\( b = 49 \\) satisfy the condition \\( b > 9 \\) and \\( b + 7 \\) divides \\( 9b + 7 \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of all such bases:\n\\[ 21 + 49 = 70 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe sum of all integer bases \\( b > 9 \\) for which \\( 17_b \\) divides \\( 97_b \\) is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).", "extracted_final_answer": null, "is_correct": false, "tokens": {"prompt_tokens": 71, "completion_tokens": 1397, "total_tokens": 1468}}
