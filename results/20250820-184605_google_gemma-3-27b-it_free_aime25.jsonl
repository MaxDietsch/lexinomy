We are given that $b>9$. We can rewrite these numbers in base 10 as follows:\n$17_b = 1 \\cdot b^1 + 7 \\cdot b^0 = b+7$\n$97_b = 9 \\cdot b^1 + 7 \\cdot b^0 = 9b+7$\nWe are given that $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$, which means that $b+7$ divides $9b+7$.\nWe can write $9b+7 = 9(b+7) - 9(7) + 7 = 9(b+7) - 63 + 7 = 9(b+7) - 56$.\nSince $b+7$ divides $9(b+7)$, $b+7$ must also divide $9b+7 - 9(b+7) = -56$.\nThus, $b+7$ divides 56. The divisors of 56 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, and 56.\nThen we have the following equations:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $b+7=1 \\Rightarrow b = -6$ (not valid, since $b>9$)\n    \\item $b+7=2 \\Rightarrow b = -5$ (not valid, since $b>9$)\n    \\item $b+7=4 \\Rightarrow b = -3$ (not valid, since $b>9$)\n    \\item $b+7=7 \\Rightarrow b = 0$ (not valid, since $b>9$)\n    \\item $b+7=8 \\Rightarrow b = 1$ (not valid, since $b>9$)\n    \\item $b+7=14 \\Rightarrow b = 7$ (not valid, since $b>9$)\n    \\item $b+7=28 \\Rightarrow b = 21$ (valid, since $b>9$)\n    \\item $b+7=56 \\Rightarrow b = 49$ (valid, since $b>9$)\n\\end{itemize}\nNow we need to verify that $b=21$ and $b=49$ actually satisfy the condition that $17_b$ divides $97_b$.\nIf $b=21$, $17_{21} = 21+7 = 28$ and $97_{21} = 9(21)+7 = 189+7 = 196$. Since $196 = 7 \\cdot 28$, $17_{21}$ divides $97_{21}$.\nIf $b=49$, $17_{49} = 49+7 = 56$ and $97_{49} = 9(49)+7 = 441+7 = 448$. Since $448 = 8 \\cdot 56$, $17_{49}$ divides $97_{49}$.\nThe sum of the valid bases is $21+49=70$.\n\nThe final answer is 70", "extracted_final_answer": 70, "is_correct": true, "tokens": {"prompt_tokens": 85, "completion_tokens": 752, "total_tokens": 837}}
