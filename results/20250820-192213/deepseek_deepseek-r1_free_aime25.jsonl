Further terms approximate this alternation but are complex to compute directly.\n\n3. **Periodicity Insight:**\n   - Observing a potential period-2 cycle for \\( x_k \\) starting from \\( x_2 \\). For large \\( k \\), odd indices settle near one value, even indices near another. Testing shows iterations after \\( x_2 \\) and \\( x_3 \\) hint at periodicity (though due to problem constraints, exact repetition isn't proven but inferred).\n\n4. **Replace paper Computations with Parity:**\n   - Since \\( 2025 \\) is odd, it maps to the pattern starting at \\( x_1 \\). However, simulation of earlier terms suggests rapid stabilization modulo the cycle. However, because the problem likely leverages periodicity mod 2 for very large \\( k \\), but given the sequence stabilizes in pairs, parity determines the term.\n\n**Reduction to Simplest Terms:**\n\n- Alternating terms generate \\( x_2 = \\frac{157}{275} \\) and \\( x_3 = \\frac{19033}{43175} \\), etc., with denominators growing rapidly. However, after extensive analysis and considering problem constraints, the key observation is that consecutive terms tend toward oscillation between approximations of two values.
