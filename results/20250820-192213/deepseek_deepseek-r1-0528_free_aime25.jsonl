The even digits are 2, 4, 6, and 8, providing 4 choices for the units digit.\n\nFor divisibility by 11, the alternating sum of the digits must be divisible by 11.

The probability that $B$ is a nonempty set with the property that the least common multiple of its element is $2025$ is $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.", "expected_answer": 237, "model_output_raw": "The set $A$ consists of all positive integer divisors of $2025$. Since $2025 = 3^4 \\times 5^2$, the divisors are of the form $3^a \\times 5^b$ where $a \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and $b \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. This gives $|A| = 5 \\times 3 = 15$ divisors.\n\nA subset $B \\subseteq A$ is selected uniformly at random, so there are $2^{15} = 32768$ possible subsets, including the empty set. The condition requires $B$ to be nonempty and the least common multiple (LCM) of its elements to be exactly $2025$. Since all divisors of $2025$ divide $2025$, the LCM of any subset $B$ is a divisor of $2025$, and the LCM is exactly $2025$ if and only if the maximum exponent of 3 in any element of $B$ is 4 and the maximum exponent of 5 is 2. This occurs if and only if $B$ contains at least one divisor with exponent 4 for the prime 3 (i.e., an element of the set $S_1 = \\{d \\in A : a = 4\\} = \\{81, 405, 2025\\}$, size 3) and at least one divisor with exponent 2 for the prime 5 (i.e., an element of the set $S_2 = \\{d \\in A : b = 2\\} = \\{25, 75, 225, 675, 2025\\}$, size 5). Note that $S_1 \\cap S_2 = \\{2025\\}$ (size 1), and the set $S_1 \\cup S_2$ has size $3 + 5 - 1 = 7$, so the complement of $S_1 \\cup S_2$ in $A$ has size $15 - 7 = 8$.\n\nThe number of subsets satisfying the condition is equal to the number of subsets that intersect both $S_1$ and $S_2$. The number of subsets that do not intersect $S_1$ is $2^{|A \\setminus S_1|} = 2^{15-3} = 2^{12} = 4096$. Similarly, the number that do not intersect $S_2$ is $2^{|A \\setminus S_2|} = 2^{15-5} = 2^{10} = 1024$. The number that do not intersect either $S_1$ or $S_2$ is $2^{|A \\setminus (S_1 \\cup S_2)|} = 2^8 = 256$. By the inclusion-exclusion principle, the number of subsets that miss at least one of $S_1$ or $S_2$ is $4096 + 1024 - 256 = 4864$. Thus, the number that intersect both $S_1$ and $S_2$ is $32768 - 4864 = 27904$. Since any subset intersecting both $S_1$ and $S_2$ is nonempty and satisfies the LCM condition, this is the number of favorable subsets.\n\nThe probability is therefore $\\frac{27904}{32768}$. Simplifying this fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{27904}{32768} = \\frac{27904 \\div 128}{32768 \\div 128} = \\frac{218}{256} = \\frac{218 \\div 2}{256 \\div 2} = \\frac{109}{128}.\n\\]\nHere, $109$ is prime and $128 = 2^7$, so $\\gcd(109, 128) = 1$. Thus, the fraction is in lowest terms with $m = 109$ and $n = 128$. Then, $m + n = 109 + 128 = 237$.\n\n\\boxed{237}", "extracted_final_answer": null, "is_correct": false, "tokens": {"prompt_tokens": 123, "completion_tokens": 11324, "total_tokens": 11447}}
